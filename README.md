Repo for a personal website project for @DeepDiveCoding cohort 20.

### Milestone 1 Feedback
Great work here - your Purpose, Audience, Goal and Persona are thoughtful, detailed, and well defined. Reading between the lines here, I get the impression that you know who you are and what sort of opportunities you're in the market for. I'm definitely looking forward to seeing your content strategy and UI design concepts to come in Milestone 2a.

Your project and files are all set up to spec and your code looks great - nice work.

Your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier IV](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). You are now clear to begin work on Milestone 2&alpha;.

### Milestone 2a Feedback
Nice work on these wireframes and accompanying content strategy - your design ideas are clear and well-defined. This will provide you with a good guide for your development phase ahead.

For your interactive portfolio gallery items, have a look at the following demo for some beautiful text-on-image ideas: https://tympanus.net/codrops/2014/06/19/ideas-for-subtle-hover-effects/. These are a bit more advanced, but a couple of simpler approaches are illustrated here: 
- http://css-workshop.com/hover-box-text-over-images-on-hover-and-more/
- http://geekgirllife.com/animate-text-over-images-on-hover-without-javascript/

**Be aware that hover doesn't work on mobile**, but for whatever solution you use ensure the effects should still function on click.

You could also consider interactive gallery functionality like [FancyBox3](http://fancyapps.com/fancybox/3/).

Be careful with the staggered layout here on mobile. You might want to stack these items on the smallest screens to ensure there is enough space to comfortably read the text - the horizontal space might get too narrow, so stagger only on screen sizes that can accommodate it well.

Additional recommendations:
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) for custom typography - it has ~1000 fonts and is easy to integrate.
- The Bootstrap built-in `fixed` and/or `sticky` classes should work fine for your navbar.
- [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) is a good quality free library for including iconography.

You might want to read ahead regarding the contact form integration, and that documentation is here: https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/class-materials/jquery-validated-captcha-form/

Your Milestone 2a passes at [Tier IV](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). You are now clear to begin development on your PWP. Looking forward to seeing your project take shape!

**We'll be building PWP in a file named index.php inside of /public_html**. Please note that no frontend-facing site files should live outside of the /public_html directory. Remember use an organized and standards-compliant directory structure to house all images, JavaScript, CSS, etc. We are done with the /documentation directory for now!

#### Edits &amp; Suggestions
- `DOCTYPE` is missing.
- be careful that indentation is accurate. Here's it's a bit off. Only indent child elements, not siblings.

### Milestone 2b Feedback
Nice work. Meeting notes left via Slack. Your Milestone 2b passes at [Tier III](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/).
