		<h1>PWP Milestone 2a</h1>
			<h2>Content Strategy</h2>
				<h3>Welcome:</h3>
					<p>
						A bold, clean typeface for the name brentTheDev. 2 words that describe the roles that brentTheDev
						plays as a creator and a developer. This will be overlaid onto a picture with my personal tech utilities
						(i.e. laptop, idea book) and Indigenous items. This will give the visitor a first impression through
						visual cues.
					</p>
				<h3>About Me:</h3>
					<p>Overall, I want the tone of this section to be personal and casual as a means of giving the visitor
						of my site an impression of who I am as a person. At the same time, I want this section to reveal my
						current skill set and professional background relevant to Web Development and Internet technologies.
						I feel like this component would help an employer identify if I'm a good fit for their team.
